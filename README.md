# Pennysia AMM Backtest & Visualization Gallery

## What Is Pennysia AMM?

Pennysia AMM is a next-generation automated market maker protocol that allows liquidity providers to take **directional positions** (long or short) on each token in a trading pair, rather than being forced into a traditional 50/50 split as in Uniswap V2.  
- **Directional Liquidity:** LPs can allocate their capital to ‚Äúlong‚Äù or ‚Äúshort‚Äù positions on either token, expressing a market view.
- **Mirrored Positioning:** For every token, you can choose any mix of long/short (e.g., 75% long Token0 + 25% short Token0), and the same for Token1, allowing for highly customized exposure.
- **Fee Redistribution:** Swap fees are distributed asymmetrically‚Äîcorrect directional positions earn more, while incorrect ones are diluted.

## What Does This Backtest Do?

This backtest suite simulates and compares the performance of Pennysia AMM and Uniswap V2 across all major trading pairs from 2021 to 2024, using real historical price data and realistic trading patterns.

### **Key Features of the Backtest:**
- **Equal Base Liquidity:** Both Pennysia and Uniswap pools start with the same amount of capital.
- **Equal User Investment:** The same user deposit is added to both pools for a fair comparison.
- **Mirrored Positioning Strategies:** Five different strategies are tested, ranging from 100% long/short to perfectly balanced.
- **Price-Driven Trading:** Swaps are simulated based on actual historical price movements, not random or synthetic trades.
- **Exact Market.sol Mechanics:** The Pennysia pool uses the real fee distribution and rebalancing logic from the Market.sol contract, including:
  - 100% of swap fees go to the long position of the output token.
  - Fees are rebalanced from the long to the short position of the input token.
- **Comprehensive Metrics:** The backtest tracks not just final returns, but also win rates, volatility, and performance by market condition and pair type.

### **What Does the Simulation Actually Do?**
1. **For each trading pair:**  
   - Fetches daily price data from 2021-2024.
   - Initializes both pools with equal base liquidity.
   - Adds an equal user deposit to both pools.
2. **For each strategy:**  
   - Allocates the user‚Äôs deposit according to the mirrored positioning (e.g., 75% long Token0, 25% long Token1, etc.).
   - Simulates weekly swaps that move the pool price in line with the real market price, using the constant product formula.
   - Applies the exact Market.sol fee and rebalancing logic for Pennysia.
   - At the end, withdraws the user‚Äôs liquidity and calculates the final value.
3. **Compares:**  
   - The final value and return for each strategy in Pennysia vs. Uniswap V2.
   - The advantage (or disadvantage) of each Pennysia strategy over Uniswap V2.
   - Performance across all pairs, strategies, and market conditions.

### **What Can You Learn From the Results?**
- Which strategies work best in which market conditions (bull, bear, volatile, stable).
- How much more (or less) a directional LP can earn compared to a passive Uniswap V2 LP.
- The impact of Pennysia‚Äôs fee mechanics on long-term returns.
- The power of directional positioning in capturing asymmetric market moves.
